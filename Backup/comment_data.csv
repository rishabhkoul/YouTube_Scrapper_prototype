0,#TheRanveerShow,Subuhi Nigar,"It has happened with me as well. I was in a Kurg resort and we  decided to trek up to the hill top till a temple , Two dogs  guided us , they were ahead of  us   all the time   showing path . when we used to sit down due to  tiredness, they also used to sit  next to us . What amazing animal Dogs are !"
1,#TheRanveerShow,Anand Kibe,"Talking about guiding path, read the story of Pilot Baba. He was falling unconscious in crashing plane when someone came into cockpit and guided him to gain control over the aircraft"
2,#TheRanveerShow,Dhiraj Jadhav,"Ur listening everyone opinion but I must admit.
What BK Shivani told few days back , that was absolute Truth.
We are in Dark phase of Kalyuga."
3,#TheRanveerShow,अहं ब्रह्मास्मि,Yes our dev and deity loves mountain that's why lots of temple situated in mountain uttrakhand
4,#TheRanveerShow,Sandeep K,"He is so true 
I went this temple 
This temple is so near to my village.
Absolutely true"
5,#TheRanveerShow,Akhil Maitreya,"The birth place of Lord Hanuman is on Anjanadri hill in Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh. It is officially proved with facts and data by TTD comittee by extensive research  derived from manuscripts of ancient Indian texts and even matching the mythological stories which all only point to this place."
6,#TheRanveerShow,Gautam Jain,"It’s just a normal everyday experience. The dogs must be used to roaming that path and would be seeing lot of visitors take that route, so it’s natural for them to take that path. 

As for sadhus asking the priest to not ask the person to move out, it’s again a very normal thing. When they see a sincere seeker they would want to let him be. 

As for being offered tea by the sadhus, it’s again the most ordinary thing. It’s early in the morning, and the person is alone meditating in the temple, and if the sadhus were having tea, they might have thought  of sharing it with him. 

It’s the most ordinary normal everyday experience to my mind."
7,#TheRanveerShow,Chandrashekar Pathepurkar,It's happened to me as well but in exactly Anjanadri Hill

31,#TheRanveerShow,Anuj Jain,There is nothing miraculous in this. Dogs can remember path and learn to guide path.
32,#TheRanveerShow,Workout Tube,Bro you are trying to be a good Hindu. I invite you as a Muslim to read the Qur'an
0,#TheRanveerShow,Aditi Gupta,"In my case i started worshipping Shiva at very young age, then in my 20's out of nowhere i felt an great attraction towards Krishna n everytime i found myself listening to krishna bhajan. Now after reading Srimad Bhagvad Geeta i got all answers and i feel less attachment with material things and i feel free within my self!!!"
1,#TheRanveerShow,A S,I must congratulate Ranveer for creating such lovely podcast contents with experts in their fields.
2,#TheRanveerShow,Sanjeevani Walimbe,Your clips are good. The questions you ask are always something that I usually  have on my mind. Thanks for doing what you are doing.
3,#TheRanveerShow,nihar show,"Shiva is the representation of all skills,he is the Mr. Dependable of Lord Krishna.Shiva did all the toughest tasks"
4,#TheRanveerShow,Niel,"Ranveer you should search about Baba Neem Karori the way he lived his life will answer all your questions, people worship him as Lord Hanuman himself"
5,#TheRanveerShow,Arjun Khadke,"No disrespect and No hate but Ranveer thinks he has gone deep in a conversation in the podcasts but never does. 
I have always noticed that the questions he asks are mostly for his own curiosity and more self sided.
 I think when you have such ""Experts"" on the show you should ask questions that make them scratch their own head and bring answer through the deepest of their minds using all of their knowledge or intellect. 
That would be a deep conversation.
Ranveer always keeps asking about what Kaala Jaadu, Are there ghosts,etc.
I sense these questions come from his own experiences in his life and he gets answer to them, too. But then he doesn't pull out the other persons experiences and knowledge.
And who the hell is this guy????
Those intros and outrows just feel to cringe and end the vibe of the ""deep"" podcast."
6,#TheRanveerShow,Mukul Mudgal,"Which ever path you take they all will lead you to the supreme God, Krishna. He has himself said it in Gita."
7,#TheRanveerShow,Niel,"Why this stupid question everywhere if Shiva is an alien? an alien is someone who ia not from earth, ofcourse by this logic you can call him alien because he does not belong to earth, whole universe including earth belongs to him"
8,#TheRanveerShow,Dhruv Sangtani,Ask such baseless question to someone like Sadhguru and see him laughing at you for at least 2 minutes.
9,#TheRanveerShow,Nandan Singh,"ab bhagwan ko v apne existence Ka prove dena padega ki wo alien h ya nhi.
such a baseless question"
10,#TheRanveerShow,Shailesh Dwivedi,SHIVA-->INFINITY ️
11,#TheRanveerShow,CptAem,"Where  there is a question on Lord Shiva the supreme God , not a valid question"
12,#TheRanveerShow,prashik vaidya,"Yeah he might be an alien,
Went to picnic near any black hole and centuaries would paas when he arrives back."
13,#TheRanveerShow,Tuhin Roy,"Om Hreem Shree Gurubheyo Namaha,
A Yogi is more fit to satisfy our thirst for Shiva,like Sri M"
14,#TheRanveerShow,Trideep Bor Saikia,Har Har Mahadev..
15,#TheRanveerShow,Ujjal das,"This is called the hypocrisy of iskcon.... shree krishna was the devotee of Lord Shiva...lord Rama was the devotee of shiva also ..in iswar Geeta Lord Rama was the student of lord shiva...he is the dev of dev....shiva never born, and never destroyed..  pagalpanthi band karo...the maturity is 
shiva= krishna= Rama...they all are the manifestations of Nirgun Nirankar Parambrahm ( the absolute truth)...they all are same in different names and forms"
16,#TheRanveerShow,Vishal Joshi,"Arey kyun faltu ki confusion laga rakhi hai,  Krishna shiva shakti Ganesha all are one god but different names."
